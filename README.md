# First-OLS-and-Random-Forrest
First attempt fitting an OLS and random forrest model.
The data was a relativly small dataset which had different socio-economic factors describing regions across Portugal. 
Our dependent variable was Bank Evaluation m2. 

I first fitted a OLS regression model and upon analysis of the summary of this regression I was able to drop some irrelevant parameters refine my model. I then used a Random Forrest regression which involved training and test data.
